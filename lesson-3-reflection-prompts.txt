When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	when working together with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because other people might make changes, that interfere with my own code,
	so it needs to be merged later.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	branches include the history of the development. fork is a cloning a repository
	from GitHub to your own GitHub account. Cloning is downloading a repository from GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	you can work with it offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

	Adding new featues or creating something, that might crash the program. That way you can
	always go back to the functioning master branch.

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can focus in the differences, which makes the code that needs to be evaluated much shorter.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can follow the development process and compare different versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: I can separate my commits logically
    cons: I might make commits with either too few or too many changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because you might have multiple files, that effect each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: view history
    git diff: compare two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always go back to a working version and check all changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
